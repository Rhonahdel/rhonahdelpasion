			<p>“Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it.”</p>
			<p>Everyone has a unique talent, and I have the ability to draw. I've always enjoyed drawing since I was in elementary level.<br><br>
			 I simply loved combining different colors and shapes. When I'm feeling down or sad, I just pick up a paint brush or a
             pencil and draw whatever I want to relieve the loneliness in my heart.<br><br>

			<h1>Important people in my Life</h1>

			<p>"Family is not an important thing. It's everything."</p>
			<p>It is essential to surround ourselves with family and friends for support and comfort in both happy and sad times.
			According to studies, having supportive relationships is a strong protective factor against mental illnesses and contributes 
			to our mental well-being.<br><br>
			Living without the experience of friendship and bond of family is equivalent to living without a soul. Human interaction is essential.
for survival in our society, but developing friendships is critical to any person's success. That is why friendship is essential.
and why we should treasure this sacred bond.</p>
